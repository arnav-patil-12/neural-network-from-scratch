# Neural Network From Scratch!

This project is my introduction to machine learning, and it involves learning about the fundamentals of neural networks and coding a simple network from scratch. The background for this project comes from _3Blue1Brown_'s Neural Networks playlist on YouTube, and _The Independent Code_'s video walking throught the code.

In this README file, I will walk through and provide notes/comments on the video playlist. I will provide detailed explanation of my code in [python_file_documentation.md]()
