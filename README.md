# Neural Network From Scratch!

This project is my introduction to machine learning, and it involves learning about the fundamentals of neural networks and coding a simple network from scratch. The background for this project comes from [_3Blue1Brown_'s Neural Networks playlist](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=aDkHxTvEsGRSUgrm) on YouTube, and [_The Independent Code_'s](https://youtu.be/pauPCy_s0Ok?si=qE2_HNfItq3hRAku) video walking throught the code.

In this README file, I will walk through and provide notes/comments on the video playlist. I will provide detailed explanation of my code in [python_file_documentation.md](PYTHON_FILE_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Chapter 1: But what is a neural network?



## Chapter 2: Gradient descent



## Chapter 3: What is backpropogation really doing?



## Chapter 4: Backpropogation calculus



## Chapter 5: But what is a GPT?



## Chapter 6: Attention in transformers



## What's Next?

From here, I would like to take a dive into convulutional neural networks (CNNs), which differ from a standard neural network. Primarily, standard neural networks employ fully connected layers, whereas CNNs apply convolution operations between the start and the end. As a result, CNN's are preferred for grid-like data such as images and sounds.
